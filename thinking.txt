1) Gates need to have a list of input and output nodes 

2) Need to establish connections between input and output nodes on gates 
    - define a function that maps an input to an output: 
        for input -> output 

3) recursive definition of connection to update

4) upon render paint canvas with changes 

5) Redux state manager / reducer / dispatch used to ____ 
    - create new gate/create new link
    - want to update state when connection comes together 
    - Creating the connection will be a dispatch event - to Redux
    - reducer -- update the store (state) 
    - every frame pull from the store 


{
    nodes: [
        {
            type: "AND", 
            inputs: [], 
            outputs: []
        },
    ], 
    IObubbles: [
        {
            value: 0/1, 
            connections: [bubble]
        }
    ]
}

1) Define the state 
    What are all of the possible slices? 

2) Actions 
    Redux requires "type" on all Actions
    Convention - use caps lock and underscores separating
